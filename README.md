# Alien Encounter

Alien Encounter is a VR game designed for the Oculus Touch to explore how exactly we might use diegetic gestures to communicate with NPCs. In the scenario you are a Star Trek officer who is beamed down to establish diplomacy with a species who speaks only using gesture. It is your task to understand and communicate effectively with them.
